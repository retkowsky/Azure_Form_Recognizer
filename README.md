# Azure Form Recognizer demos

Azure Form Recognizer, part of Azure Applied AI Services, uses machine learning technology to identify and extract key-value pairs and table data from form documents. It then outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file. Unsupervised learning allows the model to understand the layout and field data without manual data labeling or intensive coding. You can also conduct supervised learning with manually labeled data. Models trained with labeled data perform better and can also work with more complicated documents.
